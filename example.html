	<h1>jQuery accesskey plugin</h1>
	<p>
		There is an attribute on <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements,
		called <em>accesskey</em>.
		In theory, you set it to a letter, like <kbd>a</kbd>,
		and the browsers provide a convenient way to shortcut focus to that element.
		However, there is an important problem with the implementation of that feature.
		Users are not informed of the possibility in any known browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		This plugin provides a solution.
		It allows to use a simple shortcut of pressing the corresponding key,
			without any modifiers. Try pressing a letter <kbd>a</kbd> now.
		<button accesskey="a">Have you now jumped here?</button>
	</p>
    <p>
        If you want to hide the hints, just hit any key.
    </p>
	<p>
		In addition, it informs users about the possibility to use these shortcuts by 
			triggering helpful hints on the press of <kbd>Tab</kbd> button.
		Try it now!
	</p>
	<h2>Use it</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="jquery.accesskey.min.js" accesskey="d">
			Download the script</a>
		and
		<a href="jquery.accesskey.css" accesskey="d">
			the styles</a>.			
	</p>
	
	<h2>Example content</h2>
	<h3>Simple</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="#g" accesskey="g">Google</a> is a big company.
		Compare it with 
		<a href="#m" accesskey="m">Microsoft</a>, another big company.
	</p>

	<h3>Repeated accesskey</h3>
	<p>
		What if some elements have the same accesskey?
		Let us see.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#b1" accesskey="b">Barnie</a>
		<li><a href="#b2" accesskey="b">Bill</a>
		<li><a href="#b3" accesskey="b">Buck</a>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Forms</h3>
	<form action="#">
		<p>
			You can shortcut straight to input elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			<label>
				Name: <input accesskey="n">
			</label>
		</p>
		<p>
			<label>
				Life choice:
				<select accesskey="c">
					<option value="1">Go ahead</option>
					<option value="2">Go around</option>
					<option value="3">Go back</option>
				</select>
			</label>
		</p>
		<p>
			Naturally, you cannot jump out of a text entry box.
			But you can blur it with <kbd>Esc</kbd> button,
				when my plugin is active.
		</p>
	</form>
